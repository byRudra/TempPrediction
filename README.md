# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts **temperature** based on various **weather parameters** such as humidity, dew point, wind speed, precipitation, and time features like hour, day, and month. The application is built using a **Random Forest Regression** model and deployed via **Streamlit**.

Dehradun, a city in the foothills of the Himalayas, was chosen as the region of focus due to its rapidly changing and unpredictable weather patterns.
